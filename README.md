# CardForOBS
A HTML/BOOTSTRAP/Jquery card for OBS
A simple HTML file to add a timed card in OBS for livestream
Did it for the live from a VW BUs clube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVQU9Ghccg&ab_channel=TocaDasCorujinhas

To use, simply add a Browser source to your scene, select the file Card.html and it should popup!
Change as you will to display your text and images!

I do belive a lot can be improved, and if I do, I will update here!
